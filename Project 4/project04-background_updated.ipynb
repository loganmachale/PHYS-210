    "This approach works, as long as there aren't too many frames to plot for the animation. The problem is that the function `update_line()` generates a brand new plot (axis, frame, lines, etc...) at every function call. This will make generating the animation take more time and memory than necessary. One way around this is to update only the elements of the plot which need to be updated. The example below shows the same line animation where only the line is updated, while everything else stays the same. In order to do this we have to start using some pieces of a more sophisticated interface to matplotlib. Below we store the `line` object in the variable `line` so that we can later update it. The example below shows how to alter the line in a plot using an instance of a plot:"

    "## *Objectives*\n",
    "You will write a program which follows the collisional motions of particles in a box (see setup instructions below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should generate several outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output 1: Animation.** An animation that shows the particle positions over the time steps (one frame for every 2 steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output 2: Histograms, fits, and the temperature of your box of gas.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2a)** Based on the final state of the simulation you ran for Output 1, create a two-panel plot, with a histogram showing the distribution of speed $v$ of all particles in one panel, and a histogram showing the distribution of kinetic energy, $E$ of all particles in the other (where $E=1/2 mv^2$). To be able to add the analytical formulae (the fitted functions) to these histograms, they should be probability density plots, meaning that the y-axis should be probability and the area under the curve of the histogram is equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2b)** In two dimensions, the analytical expressions for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speed, $f(v)$, and the Boltzmann distribution, $g(E)$, are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(v)=\\frac{mv}{k_B T}e^{-mv^2/2 k_B T},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(E)=\\frac{1}{k_B T}e^{-E/k_B T},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} kg s^{-2} K^{-1}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature of the gas (a parameter that you need to determine). \n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should fit the analytical $f(v)$ to the $v$ histogram to find the temperature $T$ and plot this fitted function on top of the histogram. Although we can apply Poisson statistics to determine the uncertainties, the long tail in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speed and the relatively low number of total particles means that it would be very challenging to incorporate y-uncertainties into the fit in a way that will work _every_ time we run the simulation. As a result, you do not need to account for the uncertainties in the y-values when performing the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the $T$ that you found from your fit of $f(v)$ to the $v$ histogram, plot the analytical $g(E)$ on top of the kinetic energy histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2c)** Although you do not need to incorporate y-value uncertainties into your fit, you still need to determine the uncertainty in the temperature that comes from the fit. As noted at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html, the second returned array from this function, `pcov`, provides the estimated covariance of the first returned array `popt`: \"The diagonals provide the variance of the parameter estimate. To compute one standard deviation errors (uncertainties) on the parameters use `perr = np.sqrt(np.diag(pcov))`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You can communicate your temperature and its uncertainty in one of two ways.  The first option is that your code outputs a sentence giving the value of the temperature (and its uncertainty) found by fitting the speed distribution. The second, and slightly preferred option is that you include this information directly on the $v$ histogram. The displayed/printed uncertainty in $T$ should be rounded to two significant figures, and the displayed temperature rounded to have a matching number of decimal places to the rounded uncertainty. For example, if `mu = 13.443` and `dmu = 1.4533`, the displayed/printed value should read $$\\mu = 13.4 \\pm 1.5$$"

The instruction to measure distances between particles is already in the program template, and you need to build the rest from these.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the visual representation of the particle radius is much bigger than an actual molecule, but is still small enough that, given the step size and typical speeds, particles may pass through each other – that's ok.
